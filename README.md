# Get Things Done Front End

## What's in this repo?

This repository showcases my abilities as a System Engineer. It contains a simple app for task management, encompassing a full CI/CD pipeline. The implementation includes continuous integration, trunk-based development, component testing, end-to-end testing, unit testing, build processes, release processes, and versioning processes. It adheres to good practices such as Clean Code and TDD (Test-Driven Development).

## Technologies involved

The technologies used include React.js 18, TypeScript, Vite, Storybook, Styled Components, CSS, Firebase, GitHub Actions, Docker, Docker-Compose, Bash scripting, Cypress, React Testing Library, Babel, Jest, Prettier, and Axios.

### Why React.js 18, TypeScript, Vite, Storybook, Styled Components, CSS?

The idea behind using React.js 18, TypeScript, Vite, Storybook, and Styled Components is to create a small project that is easy to manage and update. To achieve this, it's crucial to maintain all the logic in the same language. With this combination of technologies, I am capable of coding primarily in TypeScript, ensuring consistency and efficiency throughout the project.
